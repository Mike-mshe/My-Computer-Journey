                <h2>Educational Background</h2>
                <p>I started my primary education at Mzwanenyi Primary School in 2005 at Baby class through to class 3. My mother relocated to Nairobi and I was enrolled at Bahati Primary School at class four. I completed my Kenya Primary Education at the same institution in 2014, scoring 325 marks.</p>
                <p>I was able to join Mbooni Boys High School for my secondary education. It was at this school I was first exposed to computers and "fell in love" with them. My future looked bright and I remember I had a dream to pursue a Bachelor's course in Computer Science. However, this was short-lived as my mother could not fully support my school fees. In 2017, I was sent home for a fees balance, never to come back again. In 2018, I was able to join AIC Mwatate Secondary, but due to institutional challenges, I was unable to continue with Computer Studies. In 2019, I transferred to Mwanyambo Secondary School for my final year due to personal reasons and advice from close friends. I was able to post a good result in KCSE 2019, a B plain of 60 points, considering the circumstances.</p>
                <p>I was on my way to join Moi University to pursue a Bachelor of Education (Science). This never materialized as the Covid pandemic hit hard in terms of financing. I was able to secure employment as a sales representative at a local supplier.</p>
                <p>Once I had a grasp of life, I was up and about taking several courses online. Be it Alison, Microsoft Learning, Google Learning, or W3schools, I undertook dozens of online courses, eagerly digesting and fulfilling my desire to get a hold of Computer Technology. But after several years, it was evident that without a clear, structured learning path, it was very hard to achieve something. I needed someone to guide me, and who would that be except a "Teacher". I had to find a way of going back to school, and this time it would not be a University. I preferred a TVET institution. I resigned from my work and was enrolled at Taita Taveta National Polytechnic.</p>
                
                <h2>Kindly support my education.</h2>
                <p>My education has come to a temporary halt due to unforeseen financial challenges faced by my donor. It is for this reason I am reaching out to friends, family and my community for support. Every contribution, big or small, gets me closer to getting back to school and to continue my path to graduation. Thank You & God Bless!</p>
